        desc2:"Kathakali is a major form of classical Indian dance. It is a story play genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful make-up and costumes of the traditional male actor-dancers.[2][3][note 1] It is native to the Malayalam-speaking southwestern region of Kerala and is almost entirely practiced and appreciated by Malayali people. Kathakali is one of the eight classical dances of India Kathakali's roots are unclear. The fully developed style of Kathakali originated around the 17th century, but its roots are in the temple and folk arts (such as Krishnanattam and religious drama of the kingdom of southwest, which are traceable to at least the 1st millennium CE. A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India.Kathakali also differs in that the structure and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike other classical Indian dances which primarily developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools.",

Theyyam consists of traditions, rituals and customs associated with temples and sacred groves of Malabar.The people of the region consider Theyyam itself as a channel to a god and they thus seek blessings from Theyyam. In Kasaragod and Kannur districts, this ritual art is mainly performed in the kavus (temples) or ancestral houses of Nambiar, Thiyyar, Vaniyar and Maniyani communities. Theyyam is typically performed by people from castes and tribes like Pulayar, Vannan, Malayan, Anhoottan, Munnoottan, Mavilan, Koppalan, Velan, Chingathan, Kalanaadi, Paravan, Nalikeyavar etc. Of these Kalanaadi people perform only in Wayanad district, while Parava, Pampatha, Nalikeyavar perform in places north of Kerala like Udupi, Krishnapuram etc. There are about 456 types of Theyyams documented. Theyyam is mainly performed by males, except the Devakoothu theyyam; the Devakoothu is the only Theyyam ritual performed by women. Devakoothu is performed only in the Thekkumbad Kulom temple. In Kerala, Theyyam is performed predominantly in the North Malabar region (consisting of present-day Kasargod, Kannur Districts, Mananthavady Taluk of Wayanad and Vadakara and Koyilandy Taluks of Kozhikode). A similar custom is followed in the Tulunadu region of neighbouring Karnataka known as Bhuta Kola."

It is performed in the Koothambalam; a place inside Hindu temples specifically designed for performing Kutiyattam and Chakyar Koothu. Ideally, the performance takes place in conjunction with festivals, presented by members of the Chakyar community along with the Ambalavasi Nambiars. It is a solo performance, by a narrator in a distinctive headgear and black moustache with his torso smeared with sandalwood paste and red dots all over the body. The headgear resembles snakes hood, to symbolise the narration by Anantha, the thousand headed serpent.",

Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms.[2][4] During the period of Mughal rule, the emperors were patrons of Kathak dance and actively promoted it in their royal courts.",

The costumes vary between the styles, with Purulia and Serakeilla using masks to identify the character.The stories enacted by Chhau dancers include those from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Puranas and other Indian literature.
